Project Overview:
DAPI (Diablo API) is intended to give AI developers the tools they need to make a bot for Diablo that will have the same information restrictions as a human player would.

Currently the project is very early in development, meaning that breaking changes to the API can happen, and there is no official change/version tracker yet. Please feel free to use the API at this time for early development, but understand that the information available to your bot could change, function calls could change, etc. In addition, documentation of the API is not strong, but these are things that will come in time.

The API has gone through a radical redesign, there is now a server/client relationship using Google Protobuf for communication. This allows the frontend to be in different languages instead of just C++. This project will focus on supporting 

Capabilities:

Read all relevant aspects of the game state that would be available to a human player.
